 The bank that I work at is in, for the most part, an urbanized area. However, there are a few plots of grass that surround the building and a small pond that sits directly behind it. The pond is, as dramatic as it sounds, a pleasant reminder of the simple beauty of life on even the toughest days.

 On Friday, there were two geese resting out beside the pond. I first saw the geese at around noon, and I was jealous of how they got to enjoy the fresh air while I had to go work. By the time I was leaving work in the evening I realized those two geese hadn't moved an inch since I had seen them almost six hours earlier. The warmth of the sun was lying down on them like a blanket, and the breeze was perfectly offsetting the heat of the sunshine. As I watched them, I wondered to myself: "Why didn't God make me a goose?"

 If God made me a goose would I be happier than I am now? Would I even be able to comprehend happiness or would I just feel an innate feeling of content (or the lack thereof)? Would I build geuine bonds and comradery with other geese? Would I feel true love for my goose-partner? Would I find purpose in lying by a pond for six hours straight? I'm not sure of the answers to any of these questions. I think that's why we have questions at all. One day, when I get to heaven, I can ask God all these things.
